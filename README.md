This release is an MVP version of twitter. It includes only the basic functionality required for the site to serve its' most basic purposes: following, posting tweets, and editing profiles.

Therefore, we have the following features on the product roadmap:

1. Likes
2. Tagging
3. Retweets
4. Threads

* Bugs

The following bugs have been identified and are on the development team's triage list. Please contact me if you find any bugs not on this list.

- Improper profile link functionality. We have temporarily removed the profile links from tweets and the navigation bar as a result.

- Cannot delete tweets.

- Cannot delete user accounts.
